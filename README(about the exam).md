# Question: 
The goal of this checkpoint is to assess your understanding of linear regression. You will work with the Ames Housing dataset to build linear regression models, interpret their metrics, and understand the model parameters. The specific tasks are as follows:

# Data Understanding:
 You will be working with the Ames Housing dataset, which contains information about various housing-related features. Your target variable (the variable you want to predict) is "SalePrice," and you will use the following numeric features to build your models:

. GrLivArea: Above grade living area in square feet.
. GarageArea: Size of the garage in square feet.
. LotArea: Lot size in square feet.
. LotFrontage: Length of the street connected to the property in feet.
You will load the dataset and select the relevant columns for your analysis.

# Modeling: 
In this section, you will build two types of linear regression models:

. Simple Linear Regression Model: You will create a model that uses one feature to predict the target variable, SalePrice. The choice of the feature will be based on its correlation with SalePrice.

. Multiple Linear Regression Model: You will create a model that uses multiple features to predict SalePrice. The selected features will be GrLivArea, GarageArea, LotArea, and LotFrontage.

You will build these models using the StatsModels library and interpret their summaries.

# Requirements: 
 The specific tasks and requirements for each part of the checkpoint are as follows:

## Building a Simple Linear Regression Model:

        1. Identify the feature with the highest correlation with SalePrice and use it to build a simple linear regression model.
        1. Summarize the model using StatsModels.
## Interpreting Simple Linear Regression Model Metrics:

        1. Determine the R-squared value for the simple linear regression model, which measures the percentage of variance explained by the model.
        1. Check if the model is statistically significant (p-value < 0.05).
## Interpreting Simple Linear Regression Parameters:

        1. Find the slope and intercept of the model, which indicate the relationship between the feature and the target variable.
## Building a Multiple Regression Model:

        1. Create a multiple linear regression model with the specified features (GrLivArea, GarageArea, LotArea, and LotFrontage).
        1. Summarize the model using StatsModels.
## Interpreting Multiple Regression Model Metrics:

        1. Compare the R-squared value of the multiple regression model to that of the simple regression model to determine which is a better fit.

        1. Identify which feature should be dropped from the multiple regression model based on p-values and correlations with other features. The chosen feature should have a higher p-value.

The checkpoint assesses your ability to build linear regression models, evaluate their metrics, and make decisions based on model summaries. It also tests your understanding of the relationship between features and the target variable.
